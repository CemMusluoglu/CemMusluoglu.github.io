Hello! I am a researcher and electrical engineer with 5+ years of research experience designing, analyzing, and implementing machine learning, signal processing, and optimization algorithms. 

As a Machine Learning Researcher at [Toqua](https://toqua.ai), I lead the efforts on improving our statistical models for ship performance predictions, working towards the decarbonization of shipping.

I was previously a postdoctoral researcher at the [Biomed](https://biomed-kuleuven.web.app) - [STADIUS](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/) group of the Electrical Engineering Department of KU Leuven, where I also pursued my PhD studies. Within my research group specialized in biomedical data processing, I developed algorithms and methods for distributed learning over networks, targeted for applications such as EEG or acoustic signal processing.

Before that, I did my MSc and BSc in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at EPFL, where I specialized in machine learning, signal processing, optimization, and telecommunications.

My research interests include (distributed) machine learning and signal processing, numerical analysis and optimization, and anything related to graphs!
