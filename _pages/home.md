Hello! I am a researcher and electrical engineer with 5+ years of research experience designing, analyzing, and implementing machine learning, signal processing, and optimization algorithms.

I have recently joined [FibriCheck](https://www.fibricheck.com) as a Data Scientist, where I will be part of the algorithms team improving methods to detect atrial fibrillation using ML and signal processing techniques.

I was previously a postdoctoral researcher at the [Biomed](https://biomed-kuleuven.web.app) - [STADIUS](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/) group of the Electrical Engineering Department of KU Leuven, where I also pursued my PhD studies. Within my research group specialized in biomedical data processing, I developed algorithms and methods for distributed learning over networks, targeted for applications such as EEG or acoustic signal processing.

Before that, I did my MSc and BSc in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at EPFL, where I specialized in machine learning, signal processing, optimization, and telecommunications.

My research interests include machine learning, signal processing, numerical analysis and optimization, in general anything related to applied mathematics!

For any discussion or questions, you can reach out to me over social media or at musluoglucem [at] gmail [dot] com
